## Picking keys
[Check this out for why the keys are the way they are as well as ideas for why some keys are chosen over
others](https://www.quora.com/Why-would-a-composer-prefer-one-key-to-another-For-example-why-would-a-composer-choose-to-use-F-minor-instead-of-A-minor-or-Bb-major-instead-of-C-major)

## Jazz
* ii V I most common
* Try just hitting a bunch of chords that are just all 4ths or all fifths all over; rainiy day with 4ths everywhere
* C(triangle) is CMaj7

* For Min7 chord use Dorian
* For dominant (7) chords use Lydian-Dominant/Lydian-Mixolydian which is just Lydian with a flat 7
